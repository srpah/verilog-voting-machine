# Voting Machine using Verilog HDL

This project presents the design and simulation of a **digital electronic voting machine** using **Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL)**.  
The system focuses on reliable vote capture, modular RTL design, and functional verification through simulation.

---

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how **digital system design concepts** can be applied to implement
a reliable electronic voting machine using synchronous logic.

The design is **simulation-based** and emphasizes:
- Button debouncing
- Long-press detection
- Secure vote counting
- Result display and winner computation

---

## Objectives

- Design an electronic voting machine using Verilog HDL
- Implement debouncing for mechanical push buttons
- Register votes for four candidates
- Support voting and result display modes
- Verify correctness using a comprehensive testbench
- Demonstrate modular RTL design principles

## System Features

- **Debounced button inputs**
- **Long-press based vote validation**
- **Voting mode and result mode**
- **LED-based vote feedback**
- **Winner and tie detection**
- **Fully modular Verilog design**
- **Self-checking simulation testbench**
